How to play:
The play starts in the Lobby of the mansion. You must click around and find objects that will provide useful hints 
or be used to unlock other items. The goal is to escape the house, or reach the music room and program the rest 
of this game to escape. 

Types of objects:
Items: regular items 
Keys: these unlock a new room
Collectable: separate from regular items, they will be used in the future

Commands:
--> pick up objects in room with left click
--> select items and collectables in inventory with left click
--> right click items and collectables to see more info about them

Other notes:
- To use an item to unlock another object, select it in your inventory
- You may have an item selected and pick up objects in the room that don't need it to be selected,
  but if an object requires a specific item to be selected, then the object is only interactable if that
  particular item is selected.
